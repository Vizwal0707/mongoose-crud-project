Create a Node.js application that connects to a MongoDB database using Mongoose. 
Define a Product model with properties such as name, price, and category. 
Implement routes or functions to perform CRUD operations: add a new product, retrieve all products, update a product by its ID, and delete a product by its ID.
Use appropriate Mongoose methods for each operation and ensure that all data validations and error handling are included.
